Chapter 101 Arrival of War
Qi Yuan’s voice resounded within every corner of Great Zhou City, giving rise to alarm and worry. After all, the pressure from seven Alpha-Origin experts was just far too overwhelming. A line-up powerful enough to break the city gates, allowing king Qi’s army to charge in without any constraints. On a battlefield like this, the intimidation and destructive power of an Alpha-Origin expert was just way too much. Thus, the countless residents that filled the city began to panic at this moment. Inside the strategy room on the city walls, Zhou Qing’s expression was as dark as a storm. Wei Canglan’s brows were tightly furrowed together, while the Black Venom King’s expression was pretty ugly. They had originally been under the impression that they had the numbers advantage with regards to Alpha-Origin experts, giving them a pretty good chance at victory. Who could have imagined that an additional six Alpha-Origin experts would appear at Qi Yuan’s side in the blink of an eye. As such, they were now at a disadvantage. From what they could see, a single mistake was all it would take for them to die today. Even the three Alpha-Origin experts had such thoughts, let alone the military officers who were now becoming rather panicky. Their originally high morale had fallen to an all time low, causing the atmosphere in the strategy room to feel rather stifling. Zhou Yuan calmly said, “There’s no need to worry everyone, although our opponent has seven Alpha-Origin experts, Great Zhou is not that much weaker.” Numerous gazes turned towards him. Seven against three was not a problem that could be solved by ‘not that much weaker’. Zhou Yuan understood from these gazes that he needed to boost their morale and immediately gave a light nod towards Yaoyao. The latter responded by patting Tuntun. Tuntun stretched lazily as an astonishing aura slowly pulsed from its tiny body. “An Alpha-Origin Genesis Beast?!” The eyes of the many officers in the room brightened as they stared at Tuntun in shock. None of them had expected such a cute little creature to possess Apha-Origin level strength. Zhou Yuan smiled as he pointed at Yaoyao and said, “My senior sister disciple here has already mastered grade 4 Genesis Runes. Her power can also match an Alpha-Origin expert.” Numerous gazes turned towards Yaoyao as whispers emerged, while the atmosphere become substantially less depressed. If Zhou Yuan’s words were true, they had the battle power of five Alpha-Origin experts on their side. Although they were still unable to take the upper hand, it was after all a formidable force. Zhou Yuan’s gaze swept over the many officers as he said in a low voice, “Everyone only needs to defend their positions. There will naturally be someone to stop the Alpha-Origin experts.” “Understood!” Upon seeing Zhou Yuan’s gaze, the officers present respectfully acknowledged, not daring to look down on him due to his age. Seeing that the morale had risen, Zhou Qing’s expression eased slightly. After consoling them again, he let them leave. Only after they left did Zhou Qing looked towards Zhou Yuan in worry as he sighed, “Even if that is the case, we are still only able to stop five Alpha-Origin experts. It will be difficult to keep the remaining two in check.” If these two Alpha-Origin experts were allowed to breach the city gates and wreak havoc, Great Zhou City would face tremendous losses. In fact, it may even shatter the morale of the soldiers. Zhou Yuan’s eyes flickered as he responded, “Father does not need to worry. I will think of a way to deal with those two Alpha-Origin experts.” “You?” Zhou Qing was taken aback, confusion in his eyes. Zhou Yuan had already asked Yaoyao and Tuntun to take action and was himself only an initial Qi Nourishing practitioner. What could he possibly do against Alpha-Origin powerhouses? Although Zhou Qing was puzzled, he nodded without saying anything. After some discussion, Zhou Yuan walked out with Yaoyao. Yaoyao suddenly asked outside the door, “How will you stop those Alpha-Origin experts?” She fully understood the extent of Zhou Yuan’s strength. The current him did not have the ability to contend with Alpha-Origin experts. Yaoyao’s bright eyes flashed as she stared at Zhou Yuan. “If you plan on borrowing Silver Shadow’s power, I’ll have to inform you that you are incapable of even activating it given the current level of your Spirit.” It was obvious that an intelligent girl like her had very quickly called to mind the battle puppet Zhou Yuan had named Silver Shadow. Zhou Yuan scratched his head as he smiled. “Big sis Yaoyao is too smart after all.” Yaoyao shook her head. “You cannot activate it. Do not force yourself.” Zhou Yuan let out a chuckle as he nodded. “It is indeed true that I am unable to activate Silver Shadow given the current level of my Spirit, but… isn’t there that ring?” Yaoyao was stunned. Only now did she realise that Zhou Yuan was referring to the silver ring he had obtained from the Jade Infant Tree. The ring had the ability to boost one’s Spirit, but had unfortunately been damaged. She had been trying to repair it all along. “So that’s your plan.” Yaoyao’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. “But I do not approve of this method. The ring may be able to strengthen your Spirit, but this will be akin to overloading yourself. The slightest carelessness will likely result in serious damage to your Spirit.” Although Zhou Yuan would be able to temporarily borrow Silver Shadow’s power with the ring, it was still extremely dangerous. After all, controlling such power was still too difficult for him. Zhou Yuan laughed before he calmly said, “If I’m unable to cross this pit, what difference would it make if my Spirit is damaged?” If Great Zhou City was conquered, Qi Yuan would not leave any loose ends behind. Zhou Yuan might be able to escape, but what about his father and mother? What about the citizens of the Great Zhou Empire? To flee alone while his country was destroyed and endure the humiliation as he tirelessly trained in anticipation of the day revenge would be his, this was something that Zhou Yuan did not like at all. In comparison, why not put everything on the line and try to grasp that tiny glimmer of hope. Yaoyao was silent for a long time, before she ultimately said, “Even so, you will only be able to deal with one Alpha-Origin expert.” Zhou Yuan responded, “I will ask father to send some Heaven Gate experts to take on the last Alpha-Origin expert. Although the price will be steep, they will be able to delay him for a while until one of us is able to free ourselves and stabilize the overall situation.” Everything had already been mapped out by him. Yaoyao sighed softly. “This sacred dragon road of yours is truly an arduous one littered with numerous obstacles.” Calamity after calamity akin to walking along the edge of a cliff, while the slightest mishap would damn him into eternal oblivion. Zhou Yuan merely smiled upon hearing this as he slowly said in a calm voice, “This is perhaps a test, a trial to determine if I really am the true sacred dragon…” ... Half a day of time only brought an endless amount of panic to Great Zhou City. News of the situation spread within the city, causing hearts of the people to worry as the atmosphere grew increasingly restless. On the south side of the city, a slender elegant girl slowly walked out from a clean courtyard, closing the door behind her. Su Youwei was dressed in a pale top and trousers, her beautiful face causing the surrounding gazes to gather on her. She paid no attention to those gazes as she lifted her fair as jade face and looked towards the city walls. She had naturally heard of what was happening and understood just how much danger Great Zhou City was currently facing. Many were secretly preparing to escape, but such thoughts were far from her mind. Although she could see how bad things looked, the lazily smiling face of a young man would unknowingly surface in her heart. He would always manage to give her confidence from nowhere. With him here, it would not be so easy to break this city. While these thoughts swirled in Su Youwei’s mind, she walked towards the city walls. As she turned a corner at a certain street, her eyes suddenly fell upon a hunched aged figure leaning against the wall. The old man’s breathing was very faint, but the passersby were already controlled by panic and naturally paid no attention to him. Thoughts of her grandfather emerged as she observed him. Hence, her footsteps stopped as she fell into thought for a while. She then retrieved a wrapped meat biscuit, squatted down and gently placed it in front of the old man. As if sensing her actions, the old man’s eyes cracked open as his murky gaze sized-up the girl in front of him. A frail old voice sounded. “Little girl, why have you still not fled at such a time?” Su Youwei pursed her red lips slightly and smiled, but she did not reply. However, her hands slowly clenched into fists. “Grandpa, leave quickly after you eat.” Su Youwei stood up. A determined look rose on her pretty face as she turned and headed towards the city walls. The old man seemed to grin as he watched Su Youwei’s leaving figure. A faint glimmer flashed in his murky eyes as he his hand closed around the warm meat biscuit in front of him while he mumbled, “I never expected to see a Ying Yang Qi Dwelling in such a remote place…” “But the resolution in this little lass’ eyes, it seems that she intends to borrow an external power. *Sigh*. So young and yet she does not fear hurting herself…”
